### Functionality (v1)

#### Basic
1. Index page to present the website's functionality

4. System for password change

#### Simple notes
1. Creation and storage in DB of simple notes (title/description/content) supporting markdown for reg. users
2. Access to a list of the user's notes, possibility to view each one

#### Vocab sets and Flashcards
1. Creation of "vocab sets" - pairs of values, term in language learnt and definition in the native language (title/desc/set)
2. Access to a list of the user's sets, possibility to open their page
3. On each set's page, a "study" button should be present, which should take the user to a page where they can access the set's flashcards.
4. Flashcards page has to have a flashcard taking up the whole page, which can be "flipped" if clicked, and arrow keys change the card

#### Daily Notes
1. Daily notes - on the homepage, each user should have the button to open their "daily notes". The page with them should contain space for recording both notes and flashcards. The notes should be saveable with a button. 
2. All daily notes should be viewable on a calendar page, with each day on the calendar as a link to that daily note (if any was saved that day).
